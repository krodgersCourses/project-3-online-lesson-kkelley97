        <h2>Learning Objectives:</h2>
        <p>By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Define what an Operating System (OS) is and its primary function.</li>
          <li>Identify common Operating Systems and the types of devices they run on.</li>
          <li>Define what a Web Browser is and its primary function.</li>
          <li>Identify common web browser buttons and describe their functions.</li>
          <li>Differentiate between Operating Systems and Web Browsers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Introduction (5-7 minutes)</h2>
        <h3>Hook:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask students what they would do if their computer stopped working suddenly, what would they miss first? 
            (Can't open apps, see or interact with screens)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bridge to OS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The brain or manager that makes everything on a divice work is calleded the Operating Systems. If you 
            don't have the OS hardware then all you have is a bunch of parts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bridge to Browswers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ask the students "When you turn your computer on, how would you get to the website you want?" Help the students
            reach the understanding one needs a operating system to get to the web browser.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Today we will focus on two fundamental pieces of software that make our searches seem magical.

        <h3>Operating systems: What is an OS?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, provides common services for computer programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analogy: Compare the OS to a conductor of a band. The conductor (OS) is not playing the instruments (hardware) but ensures all 
            the musicians (applications) will play in harmony and keep time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key functions of an OS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Memory Management: Allocates memory to programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Process Management: Manages running programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            File Management: Organizes and stores files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Device Management: Controls hardware like printers, keyboards, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            User Interface (UI): Provides a way for users to interact with the computer (e.g., graphical user interface - GUI).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Common OS Examples and Device Types (Refer to Part 1 of Worksheet):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Windows: Most common for personal computers (desktops, laptops).
          </li>
          <li>
            macOS: Apple's operating system for their desktop and laptop computers (MacBooks, iMacs).
          </li>
          <li>
            Android: Dominant OS for smartphones and tablets (non-Apple devices).
          </li>
          <li>
            iOS: Apple's operating system for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch.
          </li>

        <h2>Direct Instruction: Web Browsers </h2>
        <h3>What is a Web Browser?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is the application software used for accessing information on the Web. When you 
            enter a web address or click a link, the browser gets content from the internet and 
            displays it on the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think of the browser as a language translator and display artist. The tranlator takes raw code on a website
             and translates it and displays the information as something visually appealing and interactive.
          </li>
        </ul>
